mouse over things that move to view paths
things without paths yet will not show anything, give it a few seconds for a goal to appear
paths are not updated until following the current path is impossible, which is why the path behind something is not cleared
eventually there are no more goals because the miners are slow in DFS, then everything just stops which is by original design
