A*

based on estimate of cost to reach goal

f(x) = g(x) + h(x)  

g(x) is actual cost to reach this node from start
h(x) is estimate of cost from this node to the goal (heuristic / educated guess)


keep and open set
	- on the fringe/frontier of search
		ordered by f-values
		
		
h - manhattan distance (distance in x and y, no diagnal)
